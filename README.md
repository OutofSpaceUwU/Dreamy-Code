<!-- Roles -->
## The different roles and how to achieve them

We offer a selection of different roles to every user. Some roles are self selectable like for example `XX`. These can be applied and removed through [role reactions¹](#1-role-reactions). On the other hand some roles have to be applied through a staff member. Besides that bots also create roles for theirselves. These are listed just general purpose.
<br>As mentioned a few roles also reveal channels or categories. These is used mostly for moderation roles, but also for the `『⚠』fvck-humanity` channel. 

> The table below shows a detailed list of all roles. Have a look if you are intersted, but usually every role should be self explaining.
> <br> *The table is sorted by hierarchy.

| Category | Role | Achieving | Abilities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Bot* | Dyno | / | Bot specific |
| | Xenon | / | (Same as group) |
| | Arcane | / | (Same as group) |
| | ServerStats | / | (Same as group) |
| *Staff* | 👑Owner | Through the Owner or the roles above | Overall managment + Decision-making authority |
| | 🚨Head Administrator | (Same as group) | Substitute of the Owner |
| | 🔥Administrator | (Same as group) | Managment + Supervision of the Head Moderators |
