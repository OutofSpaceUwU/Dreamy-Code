## Planned Features

An idea of mine has been the merging of the role play servers with this main server. I (OutofSpace) am currently still waiting for feedback. For now te role play category is paused.

| Category    | Channel             | Usecase                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| *Role Play* | characters          | Introduce your character                        |
|             | organization        | Notes and anything else regarding the role play |
|             | main role play chat | Text role play                                  |
|             | RP VC               | Role play voice chat                            |

<!-- Structure -->
## The server structure

The server is structered in different voice and text channels. To keep things organized for everybody only with certain roles certain channels will be displayed. For example is the `„Äéüîû„Äè18-plus-content` channel only for users with the `18+ Content` role visible.

<!-- Roles -->
## The different roles and how to achieve them

We offer a selection of different roles to every user. Some roles are self-selectable like for example `XX`. These can be applied and removed through role reactions[[¬π]](#1-role-reactions). On the other hand some roles have to be applied through a staff member. Besides that bots also create roles for theirselves. These exists, but are not listed below. 
<br>As mentioned before a few roles also reveal channels or categories. This is used mostly for moderation roles, but also for the `„Äé‚ö†„Äèfvck-humanity` channel.

<!-- Explanation of terms -->
## Terms and their explanation. 

Under this section we explain certain terms which might not be familiar with the majority of users. 

### 1. Role Reactions

Role reactions are reactions under messages which allow users to self select a role. The actual action is performed by bots, so the roles are applied immediatly. 

### 2. NSFW (Not Safe for Work)

NSFW stands for "Not Safe for Work" and is another term for adult content. 

### 3. Ear-Rape

Ear-Raping simply means shouting inside the voice channels to "hurt" the ears of other users.
