## Planned Features

### RolePlay
An idea of mine has been the merging of the role play servers with this main server. I (OutofSpace) am currently still waiting for feedback. For now te role play category is paused.

| Category    | Channel             | Usecase                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| *Role Play* | characters          | Introduce your character                        |
|             | organization        | Notes and anything else regarding the role play |
|             | main role play chat | Text role play                                  |
|             | RP VC               | Role play voice chat                            |

<!-- Structure -->

<!-- Roles -->
## The different roles and how to achieve them

We offer a selection of different roles to every user. Some roles are self-selectable like for example `XX`. These can be applied and removed through role reactions[[¹]](#1-role-reactions). On the other hand some roles have to be applied through a staff member. Besides that bots also create roles for theirselves. These exists, but are not listed below. 
<br>As mentioned before a few roles also reveal channels or categories. This is used mostly for moderation roles, but also for the `fvck-humanity` channel. 

> *The categories and roles are sorted by hierarchy.
