<!-- Roles -->
## The different roles and how to achieve them

We offer a selection of different roles to every user. Some roles are self selectable like for example `XX`. These can be applied and removed through role reactions[[¹]](#1-role-reactions). On the other hand some roles have to be applied through a staff member. Besides that bots also create roles for theirselves. These exists, but are not listed below. 
<br>As mentioned before a few roles also reveal channels or categories. This is used mostly for moderation roles, but also for the `『⚠』fvck-humanity` channel. 

> <br> *The categories and roles are sorted by hierarchy.
